title: Anaphora in Dialogue
---
**Description:**
The topic of this seminar is **coreference resolution**, specifically in dialogue. We will learn about different types of referring expressions, look at the available corpora and review various methods that have been proposed for coreference resolution. Also, we will learn about different ways of evaluating coreference systems (including MUC, B3 and CEAF) and explore unusual and less studied cases of coreference (e.g., multilingual or multimodal coreference and discourse deixis).
 
This is a **block seminar** which means that we will have 4 introductory lectures at the beginning of the semester followed by the student presentations at the end of the semester (possibly the first week of March, TBA). All sessions will be in a **hybrid format**.
 
Each participant will be asked to give a 30 minutes presentation on one of the papers and provide a short summary and a couple of questions for other papers that will be presented. The seminar also offers an opportunity to earn 7 CP (credit points) if the student submits a term paper after the presentation (only presentation gives 4 CP).
