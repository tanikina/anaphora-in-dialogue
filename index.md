title: Anaphora in Dialogue
---
**Description:**
This course is about coreference resolution, specifically in dialogue. We will learn about different types of referring expressions, look at the available corpora and resources and review various methods that have been proposed for coreference resolution in both text and dialogue. Also, the participants will learn about different ways of evaluating coreference systems (including MUC, B3 and CEAF). This course offers a variety of topics in the filed of coreference resolution: from standard anaphora to bridging and discourse deixis and gives an opportunity to get familiar with both classical aproaches as well as recent state-of-ther-art models.
